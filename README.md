- 👀 We design and build language technology for low resource and indigenous languages, with the data and models for the first 50 languages covering up to 2.85 billion speakers.
- 🌱 Our platform builds / extends Universal Dependencies CoNLL-U annotated corpus. We parse connlu annotated corpus precisely into bi-LSTM models (built with PyTorch) that run on Gaudi2 GPU.
- :microscope: We train local language foundation models initally for lexical and syntactic performance.
- :wrench: Foundation models are further developed for named entity resolution, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling, question and answer, information extraction and search.
- :astonished: Fine tuning is then exposed for customer corpus. We deploy seamlessly to Cloud, Desktop and Mobile (Android) using Intel openVINO.
- 💞️ We joined the Intel Liftoff program in early 2024 and the Denvr Ai Ascend program in August 2025. All public data and models are open sourced, see license.txt for details in each section.
