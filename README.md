- 👀 We design and build language technology for low resource and indigenous speakers, with the first 50 languages covering up to 2.8 billion speakers.
- 🌱 Our models train, and extend, Universal Dependencies annotated corpus by: parsing CoNLL-U annotated corpus precisely into PyTorch bi-LSTM models that train on Intel Gaudi2 GPUs.
- :microscope: We train local language foundation models for lexical and syntactic performance that ake into account specific morphological features of each language / dialect.
- :wrench: Foundation models are further developed to be useful: named entity resolution, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling, question and answer, information extraction and search.
- :astonished: Fine tuning is then exposed to extend for customer corpus.
- :satellite: We deploy seamlessly to Cloud, Desktop and Mobile (Android) using Intel openVINO.
- 💞️ We joined the Intel Liftoff program in early 2024 and the Denvr Ai Ascend program in August 2025. All public data and models are open sourced, see license.txt for details in each section.
